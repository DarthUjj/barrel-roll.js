Tired of boring old webpages that do not roll? Well, you've come to the right place!

Rotates the page 360 degrees like Google's "do a barrel roll".

##Installation
To install via npm:

```
npm install barrel-roll.js --save
```

or simply copy the javascript file from the `dist` folder.

##Usage
1. Include the javascript file in your document:
 
  ```html
  <script src="barrel-roll.js"></script>
  ```

2. Call `doBarrelRoll()` to perform a barrel roll! (duh)

  Example 1:
  ```javascript
  if(doge) {
    doBarrelRoll();
  }
  ```
  Example 2:
  ```html
  <button onclick="doBarrelRoll()">Click me</button>
  ```
